Descriptions
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the travel and hospitality industry has faced unprecedented challenges (Bernama, 2020).  Many establishments have experienced the need to adapt to the evolving needs and expectations of travellers in the post-COVID era. However, the existing solutions for understanding customer preferences and segmenting the customer base in the hotel industry have certain limitations. Traditional customer segmentation methods often rely on manual analysis of customer feedback and surveys, which can be time-consuming and subjective. These techniques might not fully reflect the needs of customers and might miss significant patterns and trends in the data. Additionally, hotels find it challenging to customise their services and products to certain consumer segments due to the requirement for a thorough understanding of customer behaviours and preferences (Kitija, 2023).
